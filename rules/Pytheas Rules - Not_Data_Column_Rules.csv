3,SYMBOLS,3,SymbolChain,"At least two values in the adjacent cell context are not null equivalent values, and all such values have the same symbol chain, but the value in this cell does not"
4,SYMBOLS,4,CONSISTENT_NUMERIC,"All cells in adjacent context (excepting cells with null or null-equivalent values) have values that are numeric, but not when this cell is added to the context"
5,SYMBOLS,5,CONSISTENT_D_STAR,"All cells in adjacent context (excepting cells with null or null-equivalent values) have values that are consistently have the same two consecutive symbols in their symbol sequence, and the first symbol is D (digit), but this does not hold when this cell is added to the context"

11,SYMBOLS,11,CONSISTENT_SS_NO_SPACE,"All cells in a context (excepting cells with null or null-equivalent values) have values that produce the same symbol set signature, and that does not include a space, but not when this cell is added to the context"
12,SYMBOLS,12,FW_TWO_OR_MORE_NO_SPACE,"The pattern computed over all  symbol sequences of cell values in an adjacent context has at least two symbols not including space, but pattern breaks when the symbol sequence of the cell is added"
